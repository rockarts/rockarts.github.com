I haven't blogged in about technical things in ohh...probably 5 years. I've still been coding things in my own time but haven't really talked about what I'm working on with anyone but myself. It's becoming a bit of an echo chamber in here! So this is my first post announcing my re-introduction to bloggin with a cheesy 90s movie title. 

After spending the majority of my career learning things like refactoring, design patterns and unit testing, other things like algorithms, mobile development and "big data" have caught my interest lately. I'm very fortunate to have taken the path that I did in my learning journey in the programming world. Taking a polyglot approach to learning has allowed me to switch languages fairly easily and to be able to catch on to things really fast. 

Anyway, while I blog I'd like to not only teach myself new things but to structure my posts in a way that I challenge my readers with each post that they read. Expect homework because, well, you picked computer science as a career so that you'd never stop learning.
